This repo attempts to define the best practices when it comes to registering custom views in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

This is a living document, as the best practices are subject to change, especially as the API continues to evolve.

## Known issues

Updating a plugin creates a new leaf, even if the user intentionally closed the plugin view in their workspace.
